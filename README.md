# PINNSR-DA
This reposititory provides data and supplementary codes for the following work: 

"Data-driven discovery of governing equation for sheared granular materials in steady and transient states"

## System Requirements
### Hardware requirements
This work was conducted using a workstation with the following configurations:
- Intel 14th Gen Core i7-14700KF processor (20 cores/28 threads, up to 5.6GHz);
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card.

### Software requirements
- **OS Requirements**:
The package has been tested on Windows 11.
- **Software dependencies**:
This work was implemented on Pytorch 1.12.0 in Python, along with its associated libraries torchaudio 0.12.0 and torchvision 0.13.0, with GPU acceleration. Other detailed pip requirements can be found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/hanxuhku/PINNSR-DA/requirements.txt).

## Supplemtary Information
- **Supplementary Information for the Main Text**
	- This Supplementary Information serves as a detailed companion to the main text and is referred to therein as "SI". It comprises four sections: Supplementary Algorithm, Supplementary Results, Supplementary Discussion, and Supplementary References.
- **Supplementary Video**
	- This supplementary video is provided to facilitate readers' understanding of oscillatory simple shear. It demonstrates two loading scenarios: sinusoidal loading and Heaviside loading.
