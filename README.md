# PINNSR-DA
## Overview
Granular material has significant implications for industrial and geophysical processes. A long-lasting challenge, however, is seeking a unified rheology for its solid- and liquid-like behaviors under quasi-static, inertial, and even unsteady shear conditions. Here, we present a white-box machine learning framework to discover the hidden governing equation of sheared granular materials. The framework, PINNSR-DA, addresses noisy discrete particle data via physics-informed neural networks with sparse regression (PINNSR) and ensures dimensional consistency via machine learning-based dimensional analysis (DA). Applying PINNSR-DA to our discrete element method simulations of oscillatory shear flow, a general differential equation is found to govern the effective friction across steady and transient states. The equation consists of three interpretable terms, accounting respectively for linear response, nonlinear response and energy dissipation of the granular system, and the coefficients depends primarily on a dimensionless relaxation time, which is shorter for stiffer particles and thicker flow layers. This work pioneers a pathway for discovering physically interpretable governing laws in granular systems and can be readily extended to more complex scenarios involving jamming, segregation, and fluid-particle interactions.
